## ⚡ Fun Fact

When I'm not crunching numbers or training models, you might find me attempting to teach my pet goldfish the basics of coding. So far, it's mastered the "swim in circles" algorithm! 🐠💻

Remember, in the world of EdTech, we don't just think outside the box - we redesign the box, fill it with AI, and make it teach itself! Let's innovate together! 🚀📚
